libgudev (219-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release after the split from src:systemd. We use the version
    number 219-11, since 219-10 was the last version where it was built from
    src:systemd. See also the upstream announcement at
    http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-May/032070.html
